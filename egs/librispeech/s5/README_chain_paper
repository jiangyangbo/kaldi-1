1. Command for generating nnet3 libirspeech tdnn+CE results (Table 4, Column "CE" shows the result on decode_test_clean_fglarge):

./local/nnet3/run_tdnn.sh

2. Command for further generating nnet3 libirspeech tdnn+CE+sMBR results based on tdnn+CE model (Table 4, Column "CE->sMBR" shows the result on decode_test_clean_fglarge):

./local/nnet3/run_tdnn_discriminative.sh

3. Command for generating nnet3 libirspeech tdnn+chain results (Table 4, Column "LF-MMI" shows the result on decode_test_clean_fglarge)

./local/chain/run_tdnn_6z.sh

4. Command for further generating nnet3 libirspeech tdnn+chain+sMBR results based on tdnn+chain model (Not shown in the paper):

./local/chain/run_tdnn_6z_discriminative.sh
